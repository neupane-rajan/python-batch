# python-batch

All notes that I have written while teaching are in this repository.

## How to use

- Clone this repo: `github.com/neupane-rajan/python-batch.git`
- Open any `.py` file and run it with Python 3: `python filename.py`

## Notes

- All files are example/demo notes used for teaching and practice
- There are no external dependencies; code uses only the standard Python library
